MarkII Component Level Tests

Code in this directory provides component level tests
for the MarkII. These tests tend to test a single 
component or function. 

The first such test is the touch screen/camera tests.
These were requested during the initial production 
test setup so the camera and screens could be tested
independently of the entire product.
